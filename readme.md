Smart Dashboard

In today's IoT driven world, we still lack a robust accident prevention technology. So with the motivation of using such technology to prevent accidents we a team of six sophomores Keshav Kumar, Aman Ahlawat, Vikas Baghel, Amit Ranjan, Animesh Pathak and Hriddhi Ghosh under the aegis of Robotics Club IIT (BHU) are developing a Smart Dashboard. It will be capable of detecting accidents, rash driving and drowsiness of the driver. Based on these detections it will perform best suited action eg -calling the nearest hospital in case of crash, raising alarm in case driver is drowsy. We have used an Arduino Uno to recieve data from ADXL335 (accelerometer) and Noise detector. We have established a serial communication between Raspberry Pi and Arduino and hence used Raspberry Pi to process the data in order to make suitable detections. Detections are made on the basis of certain conditions and thresholds based on actual data.
